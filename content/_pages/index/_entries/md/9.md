This year, me and some of my friends participated to the [**Global Game Jam 2015**](http://globalgamejam.org/), a worldwide 48 hour game-development jam.

We made an accessible, simple and fun dungeon-crawler that can be played only using 4 numeric keys. [You can try find it here!](http://vittorioromeo.info/projects.html).

The game is currently work-in-progress. I'm improving the code and the balance and adding more features.

Similarly to Open Hexagon, the game is free, multi-platform and open-source. The code and the assets can be found on my GitHub page.

Enjoy! Looking forward to hear your thoughts or receive your contributions :)
