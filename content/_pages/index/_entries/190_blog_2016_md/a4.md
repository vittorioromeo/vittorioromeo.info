I've uploaded a new [Dive into C++14](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTEcWGdSiQenl4YRPvSqW7UPC6SiGNN7e) episode on YouTube:   

* **"Dive into C++14 - [3] - Generic "unique resource" wrapper"** 
</br>[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehdl6j3Ace4)

> The third tutorial in the "Dive into C++14" series covers the implementation of a generic "unique resource" class, with the same ownership semantics as `std::unique_ptr`.
> The tutorial shows the implementation of the resource class and the abstraction of the behavior of several resource types (heap-allocated pointers, OpenGL VBOs, int-based-handle APIs). 
> It also shows a simple implementation of "scope guards" as unique resources, to show how abstracting "uniqueness semantics" can be useful even in unexpected situations.

I'm currently in Berlin's Tegel airport, flying back home after a fantastic experience at [Meeting C++ 2015](http://meetingcpp.com/). I had a great time at the conference, and also gave two lightning talks.

You can [already find the code for them on Github](https://github.com/SuperV1234/meetingcpp2015) - when the videos will be uploaded I will update the repository readme.
