						<p>Delver's Choice is a fast-paced, simple and accessible, retro-styled dungeon crawler,
						that uses only four numeric keys and a simple RPG battle system</p>
						<p>The player is constantly faced with randomly-generated challenges - having to make a choice is a small period of time is the point of the game.</p>
						<p>Choices depend on your current stats, on the enemies' stats and the items in the environment. Will you be able to reach the hardest rooms of the dungeon?</p>
						<p>Originally developed for Global Game Jam 2015. Currently being developed further as a FOSS game.</p>"
